model we will be using is : distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english
which is around 66M parametrs 
6 transformer layer

as confined to limted compute can use a better model later on 


dataset : SST 2
glue banchmark
fast inference

Layer Sensitivity Ranking


run from here: python -m experiments.layer_sensitivity


Sensitivity results of six layers as of yet 
Layer 0: 0.23% drop
Layer 1: 0.23% drop
Layer 2: 0.34% drop
Layer 3: 0.34% drop
Layer 4: 0.34% drop
Layer 5: 0.00% drop
